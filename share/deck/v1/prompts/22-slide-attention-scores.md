Create a highly polished presentation slide image.

Image specifications:
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 landscape.
- Output is a single complete slide image.
- Use the dark blueprint visual quality shown in the reference image.
- Make diagrams clear, precise, and information-rich.
- Keep all text in English.
- Do not include slide numbers, footers, logos, watermarks, or Chinese text.

<STYLE_INSTRUCTIONS>
Design aesthetic: dark technical blueprint, inspired by the provided reference image.
Background: deep navy to near-black grid, subtle engineering paper texture, no light theme.
Palette: cyan #55d7ff, electric blue #2f80ed, deep navy #07182e, teal accents, small amber highlights only for warnings or targets.
Typography: crisp sans-serif, high contrast, clear labels, all English text, no Chinese text.
Visual elements: precise rectangular panels, 8px or smaller corner radius, thin technical strokes, orthogonal arrows, matrix cells, tensor labels, small code-like tags.
Density: detailed and educational, but each slide must have one main visual message.
Style rules: no slide numbers, no logos, no decorative blobs, no stock photos, no blurry text, no extra unexplained labels.

Slide content:
- Slide number for internal tracking only: 22
- Filename: 22-slide-attention-scores.png
- Type: Attention
- Layout: dashboard
- Narrative goal: Show dot product, mask, and softmax as a sequence.
- Headline text to render: "Scores become weights"
- Supporting text to render: "Q dot K, apply mask, softmax."
- Small labels to render only where useful: QK^T, mask, softmax, weights
- Visual description: Attention score matrix for BOS d e n n, with the final row highlighted and future cells blocked.
- Key points to show visually: Dot product measures match | Mask removes future | Softmax normalizes weights

Rendering instructions:
- Build the slide around the visual description, not around a bullet list.
- Use the headline as the largest text.
- Use at most two short supporting text blocks beyond labels.
- Prefer diagrams, matrices, arrows, tensor boxes, timelines, and code-like tags.
- Make every label legible at presentation size.
- Avoid fake dense paragraphs, distorted text, random numbers, and irrelevant formulas.
