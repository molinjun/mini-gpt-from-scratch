Create a highly polished presentation slide image.

Image specifications:
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 landscape.
- Output is a single complete slide image.
- Use the dark blueprint visual quality shown in the reference image.
- Make diagrams clear, precise, and information-rich.
- Keep all text in English.
- Do not include slide numbers, footers, logos, watermarks, or Chinese text.

<STYLE_INSTRUCTIONS>
Design aesthetic: dark technical blueprint, inspired by the provided reference image.
Background: deep navy to near-black grid, subtle engineering paper texture, no light theme.
Palette: cyan #55d7ff, electric blue #2f80ed, deep navy #07182e, teal accents, small amber highlights only for warnings or targets.
Typography: crisp sans-serif, high contrast, clear labels, all English text, no Chinese text.
Visual elements: precise rectangular panels, 8px or smaller corner radius, thin technical strokes, orthogonal arrows, matrix cells, tensor labels, small code-like tags.
Density: detailed and educational, but each slide must have one main visual message.
Style rules: no slide numbers, no logos, no decorative blobs, no stock photos, no blurry text, no extra unexplained labels.

Slide content:
- Slide number for internal tracking only: 30
- Filename: 30-slide-sampling-loop.png
- Type: Implementation
- Layout: linear-progression
- Narrative goal: Explain generation as repeated forward passes.
- Headline text to render: "Generation reuses the same model"
- Supporting text to render: "crop context -> logits -> sample -> append"
- Small labels to render only where useful: context, logits, sample, append
- Visual description: Generation loop diagram with token context growing one box at a time from d e n to dennis.
- Key points to show visually: Start from BOS or a prompt | Read final-position logits | Sample one token and repeat

Rendering instructions:
- Build the slide around the visual description, not around a bullet list.
- Use the headline as the largest text.
- Use at most two short supporting text blocks beyond labels.
- Prefer diagrams, matrices, arrows, tensor boxes, timelines, and code-like tags.
- Make every label legible at presentation size.
- Avoid fake dense paragraphs, distorted text, random numbers, and irrelevant formulas.
